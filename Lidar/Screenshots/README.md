Notice: The WPF control used for display in polar chart is not included. 

- In the screen shot with white is a standard "Actipro Software" chart used. SO normally it should work with every chart if you doesn't have an chart control with "Polar" view.

- The one with blue background, I tested an additional implementation of "Polar" chart display on my WPF chart implementation.

# farif - Find And Replace Text In Files, Harmonize Line Feeds

The "farif" project can be used to "find and replace multi line text in files".
- The encoding of the text files should be preserved. 
- The configuration will be saved under "%UserProfile%\AppData\local\beCee_Soft_Art"


The second point is it can be used to harmonize and remove different line endings in files. 
(e.g. having only "\r" or "\n" or "\r\n" in files, not more mixed crap)


A application hybrid for using same program on desktop application and as console application is on going.
